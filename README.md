Carz is a plugin that offers the ability to add drivable cars, car ownership, car upgrades, fuel and uses economy; offering an immersive role-playing experience to any server.<p />
Add a whole new level of role-play to any server that uses roads, perfect for city servers. Carz signs can be placed to act as Car Showrooms, Mechanics and Fuel Stations.<p />
First released in July 2012, becoming my most downloaded plugin to date. Carz is now open-source, allowing you to contribute ideas and enhancements. Carz offers an API, custom events and placeholders to help build your perfect server.<p />
