## About Carz

Carz was originally created to add driving role-play to my City server, it has since been updated with the functionality to purchase a Car (Minecart) and lock it to your player, upgrade the car's speed, manage its fuel and apply speed and launch effects. The plugin is fully configurable to match the needs of any server.

To allow for a more immersive experience, you can limit players to interact with Carz signs instead of commands; for example putting a refuel sign in a Petrol station.

Carz can integrate with any Vault compatible Economy plugin to allow for monetary purchases.
