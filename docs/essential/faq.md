#### How do I give Players permission to drive?

If you have a permission plugin, you will find all of the [permissions here](permissions.md). If you don't want to use permissions, you can disable `Other.UsePermissions` in the `config.yml`.

#### How can I use the Carz models? ####

I have created a resource pack that replaces each colour of GLAZED_TERRACOTTA with a matching Car model.

In the `server.properties` set `resource-pack=https\://a5h73y.github.io/Carz/files/resource-packs/CarzPack_1.0.zip`.

Now you can create any type of Car you want, then setting the Fill Material to (COLOUR)_GLAZED_TERRACOTTA.

If you want an example of populated CarTypes, take a look at [my config.yml](https://a5h73y.github.io/Carz/files/resources/config.yml) and copy them into your config.yml.

## Terms / Meanings

#### Config

Carz is incredibly customisable, allowing you to modify the plugin exactly to what your server requires. In your server, Carz will have a folder of many configuration files, shortened to config. `config.yml` & `strings.yml` are the only files we suggest you edit, unless you know what you're doing. Some server implementations don't save the changes upon restarting the server, so we highly suggest you use the **/carz reload** when you've made any config changes, then you'll be safe to restart your server without losing any changes.
