                        <p>Carz was a plugin created to add role-play to my City server. You are able to purchase a Car (Minecart) and lock it to your player, upgrade your car's speed and manage your fuel. Everything is configurable to match the needs of any server.</p>
                        <p>When you become the owner of a Car, no other player will be able to enter / break your car.</p>
                        <p>The players are able to interact with signs instead of commands, to allow for a more immersive experience; for example putting a fuel sign in a Petrol station.</p>
                        <p>Carz can integrate with any Economy / Vault compatible plugin to allow for monetary purchases.</p>

                        <h2 id="commandHelp">Carz Commands</h2>
                        <p>Each individual command can be disabled in the config.yml, to allow for full configuration. The available commands are as follows:</p>
