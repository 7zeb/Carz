            <h1>Part 3: Block Types</h1>

            <div id="contents-placeholder"></div>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>For each Block Type, you are able to specify a list of Materials which make up that action. The available actions include: climb, placeable, speed and launch.</p>
            <p class="no-margin">Each of these can be added to using <strong>/carz add (type) (Material)</strong>. Some may need an extra argument for the amount, such as the strength of the speed block or the amount of height from a launch block.</p>
            <p class="font-italic">The contents of each block type are stored in the blocks.yml config file.</p>

            <h2 id="climb">Climb Block</h2>
            <p>Climb blocks provide the ability for a car to climb up certain types of Materials. The climb mechanic will check the block in front of the Minecart for a valid Material, check if there is space above it to climb to, then proceed to elevate the car up the block.</p>
            <p><strong>If there are no specified Climb Blocks, EVERY Material is climbable.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="placeable">Placeable Block</h2>
            <p>Placeable blocks provide the ability to restrict where players are able to physically place Cars.</p>
            <p><strong>If there are no specified Placeable Blocks, EVERY Material is placeable.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="speed">Speed Block</h2>
            <p>Speed blocks provide the ability to give the car an extra speed boost when driven over, before gradually returning your car to it's normal speed.</p>
            <p>Speed blocks are also able to lower the cars speed when driven on, for example if the car should drive slowly on grass then set the speed block to a value below 1.0.</p>
            <p>The value specified is a multiplier of the car's maximum speed, so <code>10</code> would be 10x their speed, and <code>0.1</code> would be 10% of their speed.</p>
            <p class="font-italic">There is validation to prevent numbers below 0 and over 100. Anything exceeding 100 will cause the Car to almost teleport forward which isn't advised. Anything under 0 will seemingly reverse the car, and could be used to restrict the car from entering certain areas. If desired, manual editing of the <code>blocks.yml</code> file is required.</p>

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p class="no-margin">Value: 10</p>
            <video autoplay loop controls>
                <source src="" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <p class="no-margin">Value: 0.1</p>
            <video autoplay loop controls>
                <source src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PiercingMetallicItaliangreyhound-mobile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <h2 id="launch">Launch Block</h2>
            <p class="no-margin">Launch blocks provide the ability to add a y velocity of the car, giving the illusion of launching them into the air.</p>
            <p>It's worth noting that values between 0.0 and 2.0 seem to be most effective, anything over 2 will launch too high.</p>
